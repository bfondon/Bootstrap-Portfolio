# Bootstrap-Portfolio

https://bfondon.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

This is my online portfolio page to host my work. I used Bootstrap and Bootswatch for framework and theme, with icons from Semantic-UI.
So far I've run into problems with formatting and styling consistencies for my footers on each page. I plan to revisit and fix sometime in the near future. I would also like to add more interesting styling and elements in the future as well.
